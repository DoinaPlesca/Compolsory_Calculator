# üìò Calculator App ‚Äì Full Stack Microservices Project

##  Project Overview

This project implements a **full-stack calculator application** designed for **cloud deployment**, **scalability**, and **automation**.  
It follows modern **cloud-native microservices architecture** and satisfies **production-grade requirements**.

The solution includes:

-  **Frontend**: Angular Single Page Application (SPA) for user interactions.
-  **Backend APIs**:
    - **BasicCalculatorApi** ‚Äì simple operations (+, -, *, /).
    - **AdvancedCalculatorApi** ‚Äì advanced operations (sqrt, %, ^, etc.).
-  **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores user calculation history.

Everything is integrated through **Azure**, **GitHub Actions CI/CD**, **Docker**, and **Feature Management**.

##  Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Design for Rollback (Versioned GitHub Repository)

- All application code (frontend and backend) is stored in a **GitHub repository** with full version control.
- Rollback is achieved by:
    - Reverting to a previous Git commit.
    - Re-triggering the deployment through GitHub Actions.
- Manual redeployments ensure that previous working versions are quickly restored if needed.

üîπ **Planned Future Improvement**:  
Introduce **Azure Deployment Slots** for faster, automatic rollback without redeployment (instant swap between Staging and Production).

‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Reliable rollback process enabled via Git versioning. Future plan: zero-downtime rollbacks.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Design to be Disabled (Feature Toggles)

- Integrated **Microsoft.FeatureManagement** in the backend.
- **Save Calculation History** feature can be dynamically toggled ON/OFF at runtime without requiring redeployment.
- Frontend adapts dynamically based on backend feature state.

‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Features can be enabled or disabled live, improving flexibility and safety.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Build Fast, Release Small, Fail Fast

- Microservices are separated:
    - **BasicCalculatorApi** and **AdvancedCalculatorApi** can be built and deployed independently.
- Frontend builds independently from the backend.
- GitHub Actions automates builds and deployments on every push to the `main` branch.

‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Smaller, faster releases, minimized risk of failure, and easier troubleshooting.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Automation Over People (Full CI/CD Pipeline)

- Full CI/CD setup using **GitHub Actions**:
    - Checkout repository.
    - Build Angular frontend and .NET Core backends.
    - Publish artifacts.
    - Deploy automatically to **Azure Web Apps**.
    - Database connection strings and secrets securely injected via **GitHub Secrets**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Fully automated deployment process; no manual intervention required for deployment.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Design for Two Axes of Scale (Scale Cube Architecture)

- **X-Axis (Horizontal Cloning)**:
    - APIs are deployed with **multiple replicas** to allow for load balancing and horizontal scaling.
- **Y-Axis (Functional Decomposition)**:
    - The calculator logic is split into **two microservices**:
        - `BasicCalculatorApi` (basic operations)
        - `AdvancedCalculatorApi` (scientific/advanced operations)

‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: System is prepared to scale horizontally (user load) and functionally (new services).

##  Technologies Used

- **.NET Core 8 (ASP.NET Web API)**
- **Angular 17**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker / Docker Compose**
- **Azure App Services** + **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
- **Azure Deployment Slots** *(Planned)*
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD Pipelines)**
- **Microsoft.FeatureManagement**
